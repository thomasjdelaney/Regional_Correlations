A repository for calculating the pairwise correlations between neural firing data from many neurons in different brain regions, then clustering these correlations, then comparing this clustering to the biological partition of the neurons.

Note that the neuropixels data shared by Nick Steinmetz is the databased used here. But it is not contained within the repo, because it takes up too much space.
